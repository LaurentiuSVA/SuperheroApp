# How to Run the Application

## Frontend: React Application

Navigate to the `humble-superhero-frontend` directory and run the following commands to start the React application:

`cd SuperHeroAPP/superhero-app/humble-superhero-frontend`
`npm install`
`npm start`
This will start the frontend server on http://localhost:3000.

## Backend: NestJS Application

Navigate to the `humble-superhero-api` directory and run the following commands to start the NestJS backend server:

`cd SuperHeroAPP/superhero-app/humble-superhero-api`
`npm install`
`npm run start:dev`

This will start the backend server on http://localhost:3001.
Both frontend and backend need to be running for the full application to function correctly.

## Application Flow

The app has a simple interface where you can view a list of superheroes. On the homepage, there are 2 superheroes displayed by default.

From there, you can:

Add New Superheroes: There’s a form where you can enter the superhero's name, superpower, and humility score. Once you submit, the superhero will appear in the list.

Delete Superheroes: You can delete any superhero from the list by clicking the delete button next to their name.

## Team Collaboration

If I were working with a teammate, we could break down tasks based on our strengths.
For example, I might focus more on improving the backend API logic and ensuring data flows smoothly from the frontend, while my teammate could handle the UI/UX design.
I believe in code reviews as a way to learn from one another. I’d make sure to provide constructive feedback that’s both encouraging and helpful, and I’d also be open to receiving feedback to improve my own work.

I’m definitely open to feedback and suggestions for how this could be better. There’s always room to learn and improve, and I value any insights that can help me grow as a developer.

## Improvements

If I had more time, I’d definitely spend it cleaning up the UI a bit more. Maybe add some simple animations or transitions to make the app feel smoother.
I’d dive into adding more tests. I’d also explore adding user authentication to make it more secure and customizable.
